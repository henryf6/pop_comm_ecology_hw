#Problem 1

In this problem we look to find the density of duckweed plants per $m^2$ after 47 days. We will estimate the future population using the exponential growth formula, $N_t = N_0 e^{rt}$ where the initial population, $N_0$, is 11.1 duckweed plants per $m^2$.  We can calculate the rate of unitless population change, r, by dividing the estimate after 20 day from the initial population.

```{r}
r = 23.5/11.1
r
```

Thus with r= 2.12, we can calculate $N_{27}$ as $N_{27} = 11.1 e^{2.12\times47}$.

```{r}
n27 <- 11.1*exp(2.12*47)
n27
```

Thus after a total of 47 days, the population density will be $2.08\times10^{44}$ duckweed plants per $m^2$.
