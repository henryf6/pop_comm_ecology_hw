# Problem 1

## Part a 

Based on Figure 1, interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. The Fruit Dove population will out compete the Cotingas and thus their population is not threatened.
```{r, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fruit Dove and Spangled Cotingas Phase Diagram"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

#create empty dataframe
df <- data.frame()

#create empty ggplot with appropriate ablines

ggplot(df) + geom_point() + xlim(0, 5) + ylim(0, 5) + geom_abline(intercept = 1.25, slope=-1.25, color = 'purple') + geom_abline(intercept = 1, slope = -1.1, color = 'orange') +
  theme_tufte() + xlab('Dove Population') + ylab('Cotingas Population') + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "purple"),
         axis.title.y = element_text(colour = 'orange'))

#Sam, pretty please check my conclusion on this and make sure I didn't get this backward :)
```




## Part b

In Figure 1, the conclusions based on the intercepts of the axes are constrained by the following be true: $\frac{k_c}{\alpha_{cd}}<k_d$ (x-axis) and $k_c< \frac{k_d}{\alpha_{dc}}$ (yaxis). If the carrying capacity of the Cotingas violates these constraints then the conclusions in Part a would change.
